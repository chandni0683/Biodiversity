# Biodiversity
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer and to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

## Results
I was able to build the bar chart, bubble chart and the gauge chart. When the dashboard is first opened in a browser, ID 940â€™s data should be displayed in the dashboard, and all three charts should be working according to the requirements when a sample is selected from the dropdown menu. Below is the screenshot for the same.
